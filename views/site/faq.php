        <div class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-tl ui-corner-tr">Questions about your devices</div>

        <div class="accordion">
            <h3 class="first">Do I need to remove the data from my device?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>We will erase all data from your device. However, we recommend that you remove your personal data before sending your device to us.  Smartphones are as different as the people who own them and therefore have different ways of deleting data or resetting the software.  Look in the index of your manual (if you have it) for items such as "delete data" or "reformat device" or go to the manufacturer's website and do the same.  Data includes your contacts, SMS, pictures, videos and music, calendar entries, etc.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How many devices can I send?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>There is no limit to the number of devices you can process using ezBuyBack.com. The more devices you send in, the more cash you receive!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How do I find out the make and model of my device?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>If you don't know the make and model of your device, we suggest that you remove the battery casing. The model number is normally located under the battery.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>I can not find my device listed on your site.</h3>
            <div>
                <p>There are many makes and models of device dispalyed on ezBuyBack.com, but it's not always possible to list every single mobile on the site. If you can't find your phone, please contact our customer service team with the make and model via contact us page.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How do you determine the condition of a device?</h3>
            <div>
                <p><strong>PERFECT CONDITION</strong></p>
                <p>Device is in perfect condition and looks like new. No signs of wear or scratches, has to be 100% functional and include original box with accessories.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>GOOD CONDITION</strong></p>
                <p>Device is in good condition and 100% functional. It can have little wear but no cracks in the screen, missing buttons or bad charge ports is allowed. </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>FAIR CONDITION</strong></p>
                <p>Device is in fair condition and 100% functional. It can have lots of scratches but no cracks in the screen, missing buttons or bad charge ports is allowed.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>My device has no value, can I still recycle it?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, we will recycle your device free of charge to help protect the environment.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>My device is damaged.  Will I get any money for it?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>In many cases we will offer you the broken value for your damaged phone, but this depends on the amount of damage and whether or not we are able to fix it. For example, if your device has water damage, we are only able to recycle the handset. However, if the screen is cracked (but not bleeding) we can often fix this.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Is my device is in FAIR condition, if it works but has a broken screen?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>It is highly likely that you will still receive payment for your device. As long as the screen isn't bleeding, there is no evidence of water damage to the device and it powers up. If it requires a new screen (which is expensive to replace) we will condition it as broken.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Is my device FAIR condition if the battery is dead?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, provided you know that the phone otherwise works then it's fine to sell as FAIR. However, payout will be changed.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How do I delete my personal data from my device?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>We offer all our client access to clear instructions on how to delete all personal data on your device. Just send an email to support@ezbuyback.com along with the make and model of your device and we will send them to you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What if my device is Network locked?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>We accept Network locked devices and pay the full value.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Do you accept fake device?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>No. There are a growing number of mobile devices that look very similar to the genuine products, but are illegally produced and may be dangerous to use. If we receive a device which is fake, we will safely recycle it, but you will not receive any money for it.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Do you accept stolen devices?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>No. We use CheckMend, a crime protection database. We check every handset received against this database. If it is registered as crime-related we will report it to the relevant authorities for further action and you will not be paid for the exchange.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Do I get a higher price for a new device or rare color?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The newer your phone is, the more it is worth. We don't offer more if it is an unusual color.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What is an IMEI number?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>This stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, it's a serial number which is unique to your mobile phone. You can usually find this number printed under the battery casing (along with a barcode). Alternatively, if your phone switches on, just type in *#06# on the keypad and the IMEI number will be displayed on the LCD on your mobile.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="last">Is the IMEI number important?</h3>
            <div class="last">
                <p>It's only important if you forget to either; enclose the packaging slip, tell us your Order Number, or enclose a print out of your confirmation page (from the website) when you send us your phone. If you know your IMEI number, you can tell us what it is and we can almost instantly find your mobile if it has arrived at our processing office.</p>

    <div class="qa-wrapper">
        <div class="ui-widget-header ui-corner-tl ui-corner-tr">Questions about your Order</div>

        <div class="accordion">
            <h3 class="first">What will you send me to confirm the order?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>If you have registered your handset on ezBuyBack.com you will receive an Ordernumber at the time of the transaction. You will also be sent a confirmation of the transaction via email. As soon as we receive your device, we will email you a confirmation.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>My device is worth a lot of money on ezBuyBack.com. Is it safe to send it using the free shipping label?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>We recommend using USPS Insurance for high value devices (more than $50) as we can not take responsibility for any loss or damage caused in transit.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How long before I get my money?</h3>
            <div>

            </div>

            <h3>You have offered me a different amount for my device?</h3>
            <div>
                <p>With so many devices and models, it is often difficult to tell the difference between them. Some may look the same but have a different value. We operate a barcode scanning system which scans the IMEI number of the handset to guarantee that we have the correct model. It may also be the case that your phone was of a different condition than the one you sent to us and therefore a reduced amount would be paid. Similarly, if you thought your handset was FAIR condition and we found that it was actually in GOOD condition, then we will send you the higher amount.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>How long is my order valid for?</h3>
            <div>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We recommend that you send it to us as soon as you register the device on the website. as we are not liable for delays caused through shipping. The longer you wait, the higher the risk that your 14-day guaranteed quote will expire.</p>
